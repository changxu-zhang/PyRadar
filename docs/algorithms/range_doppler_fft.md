# Range-Doppler FFT in FMCW Radar Signal

## Introduction

Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar is a type of radar system that emits a continuous wave whose frequency is modulated over time. It is widely used in various applications, including automotive radar, traffic monitoring, and remote sensing. The Range-Doppler FFT technique is essential in FMCW radar for detecting targets, determining their range, and measuring their velocity.

## Concept Overview

FMCW radar operates by transmitting a frequency-modulated signal and receiving the echo from the target. The key concepts in FMCW radar include:

- **Range Measurement**: The distance to the target is determined by measuring the time delay between the transmitted signal and the received echo.
- **Doppler Measurement**: The frequency shift of the received signal, due to the target's motion, provides information about its velocity.

The combination of range and Doppler measurements allows the radar system to accurately identify and track multiple targets simultaneously.

## Range Measurement

The transmitted signal can be expressed as:

\[
s(t) = A \cdot \cos(2\pi f_0 t + 2\pi \frac{K}{T} t^2)
\]

where:
- \( A \) = Amplitude of the signal
- \( f_0 \) = Initial frequency
- \( K \) = Chirp rate (the rate of change of frequency)
- \( T \) = Chirp duration

The received signal, after reflection from the target at a distance \( R \), will be delayed by \( \Delta t = \frac{2R}{c} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The received signal can thus be represented as:

\[
s_r(t) = A \cdot \cos(2\pi f_0 (t - \Delta t) + 2\pi \frac{K}{T} (t - \Delta t)^2)
\]

## Doppler Measurement

When the target is moving, the frequency of the reflected signal is shifted due to the Doppler effect. The Doppler frequency shift (\( f_d \)) is given by:

\[
f_d = \frac{2v}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( v \) = Target velocity
- \( \lambda \) = Wavelength of the transmitted signal

The overall received signal can be expressed as:

\[
s_r(t) = A \cdot \cos\left(2\pi f_0 t + 2\pi \frac{K}{T} t^2 + 2\pi f_d t\right)
\]

## Range-Doppler FFT

The Range-Doppler FFT is used to simultaneously extract range and velocity information from the received signal. This is accomplished by performing two-dimensional FFT on the received signal data, where:

- The **first FFT** is applied along the time axis to obtain range information.
- The **second FFT** is applied along the chirp (or time) axis to extract Doppler information.

### Mathematical Representation

1. **FFT for Range**: The first FFT is applied on the received signal over multiple chirps, allowing us to obtain the range spectrum:

\[
R(f) = \text{FFT}\{s_r(t)\}
\]

2. **FFT for Doppler**: The second FFT is applied on the range profile to obtain the Doppler spectrum:

\[
D(f_d) = \text{FFT}\{R(f)\}
\]

## Conclusion

The Range-Doppler FFT technique in FMCW radar is a powerful method for extracting both range and velocity information of targets. By utilizing the properties of frequency modulation and the Fourier transform, radar systems can efficiently detect and track multiple objects in real-time. Understanding the mathematical principles behind this technique is crucial for designing and optimizing FMCW radar systems for various applications.
