This repository aims to implement basic functionalities of FMCW radar using Python. The goal is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use toolkit for radar signal processing. The examples implemented include:

- Range Doppler processing
- Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation
- Ray tracing simulation


API Configs:
- pyradar.sensor
- pyradar.rsp
- pyradar.simulation
- pyradar.visualization
